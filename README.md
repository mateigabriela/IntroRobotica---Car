# Project Overview: Simulation of a Car's Functionality Using the Arduino Platform

## 1. What does the project do?  
My project consists of creating an interactive system that simulates the basic components and functionality of a car using an Arduino platform. It includes the following components and features:

- **Buttons**: Control the brake, clutch, and acceleration, simulating speed control and stopping.  
- **Joystick**: Used as a gear shift lever to simulate transmission levels.  
- **LCD Screen**: Acts as a virtual dashboard, displaying information such as:  
  - Current speed  
  - Total mileage  
  - Gear shift position  
  - Other essential data.

## 2. Project Purpose  
The main purpose of this project is to develop an educational platform that facilitates the understanding of the basic principles behind the functionality of a modern vehicle. It provides the opportunity to explore concepts in electronics, programming, and automation in a practical and hands-on way.  

The project aims to:  
- Help users understand the interaction between hardware and software components.  
- Develop practical skills in designing and implementing integrated systems.  
- Demonstrate how sensors and electronic components can be used to simulate a complex system like a car.

## 3. Inspiration for the Project  
I started with the idea of combining learning with practical applicability, drawing inspiration from the complexity of modern automotive systems. I wanted to create an accessible and educational model that reflects, on a smaller scale, the basic functionality of a car.  

The main goal was to put into practice the knowledge I gained in microcontrollers and offer an interactive experience to users.
